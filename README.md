# 👋 Hi, I'm Borja

I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer based on the Gold Coast, Australia, with over a decade of experience building scalable, performant, and user-focused web applications.

💡 I specialise in:

* ⚡ Front-End Architecture (JavaScript, Aurelia, Vue, React, Next.js)
* 🛍️ E-commerce Development (Shopify, WooCommerce, Liquid)
* 📐 UX-Driven Interfaces and Performance Optimisation
* 🧰 Symfony APIs, PHP, and AWS for full-stack functionality

Most of my work has been part of long-term product teams or enterprise projects, so the code stays private, but the experience runs deep.

## 🔭 Currently

I'm leading the Shopify migration for a well-established e-commerce brand, with a focus on ensuring SEO continuity, refining UI/UX, and integrating third-party services.

## 📈 Previous Highlights

* Led the front-end and full-stack efforts at **We Brand**, the enterprise platform at Desygner
* Built internal tools and Chrome extensions to improve developer workflows
* Delivered multi-language WordPress solutions and SaaS features used by thousands

## 🌍 Outside of Work

When I’m not shipping features, I’m usually on a **padel court**, **surfboard**, or doing **CrossFit** to stay active and reset my mind.
